@RestController sets the right response adapt for the HTTP protocol

Data Binding is the process of converting JSON data to a JAva POJO
Serialization is a synonym
Data Binding in Spring is made with Jackson which is automatically included
Jackson just call the setters method of the class to translate from json to Java POJO
From Java POJO to JSON, jackson uses getters
This convertion happens automatically if everything is set in the right way

path variable is when there are curly brakets in the path and we can use that variable in the code
/api/sutdents/{studentsID}
to use it in the code, use @PathVariable for the argument of the function
notice that the text inside the brakets and the name of the variable must be the same

@PostConstruct is called just once after initialization of the bean properties.

To handle exceptions:
- create a throw method for the (eventually custom) exception 
- create a custom exception if needed
- create an error class that will be inserted in the exception handler
- create an exception handler as method in the class that will throw the error
  it must return "ResponseEntity<>" with the error class defined
  here you can define with settters: the status, the messages and the timestamps
  use the annotation @ExceptionHandler for this method

@ControllerAdvice is a notation used in Spring.3x for handling global exceptions

It's a bad practice to insert in the endpoint the actions. We should use the http actions.

Service Facade design patter is used to implement a serivece layer
it is useful because it is an intermediate layer for custom business logic
integrate data from multiple sources
it's a best practice to have a service layer
@Service annotation for this layer

Another best practice is to apply transactional boundaries at the service layer
it0s the service layer's responsability to manage transaction boundaries
